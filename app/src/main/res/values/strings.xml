    <string name="full_name">Mom\'s Friendly Robot Company</string>
    <string name="full_name_description">Founded in the mid-2920s, Mom\'s Friendly Robot Company made it big in 2972 after Mom was contracted by DOOP
        to mine the large deposit of dark matter in the planet Vergon 6.\r\nSince then the company has been responsible for the design and manufacture of many models of robots on Earth.
        These robots descend from a Sport-Utility Robot created by Professor Hubert Farnsworth in 2928, which sacrifice fuel efficiency for a robot with more flexibility.
        Mom\'s Friendly Robot Company also provides existing robots with spare parts and Mom\'s Old-Fashioned Robot Oil.
