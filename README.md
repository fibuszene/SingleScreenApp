## Project Overview
To test your skills from this free course, design and implement a single screen app that displays information about a fictional small business. Think along the lines of your favorite coffeeshop, local restaurant, or that gem of a store that sells those rare comic books or records.

**Suggested App Ideas:**

1. Details about a small business in your neighborhood
1. Contact info and description about your workplace or school
1. Info about a special interest group (like a club or sports team) youâ€™re part of and how new members can sign up

I chose #1 because it kinda is it's just the wrong time. 

**Requirements**

Your design must include:

- [x] Business name (MomCorp)
- [x] At least one photo representing the business (Header Image -> Company Logo)
- [x] Two or more other pieces of information, such as:

**Contact information for the business (eg phone number, email address, website)** (Some work with the autoLink property)

**Address of the Business** 

**Description of business** (Way to long)

**Hours of operation** (Click to expand)
